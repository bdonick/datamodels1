The database product Integrated Data Management System (IDMS) (https://www.idms.com/) is an open-source database. It has a network data model type. The primary host model for IDMS is a client/server model. Additionally it can be hosted by being embedded. Similarly to how java accesses most databases, a JDBC driver is required. Which can be loaded through the system the user runs Java on. For python to access the IDMS database all the user needs to do is download the most recent IDMS API. Once downloaded the user will have access to the IDMS server and capabilities.
