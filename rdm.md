The database product Raima Database Manager(RDM) (https://raima.com/) is an open-source database. It has a network data model type. The host model for RDM is an ACID-compliant embedded database (which is just a specific type of embedded database). Java can access RDM by using the JDBC 3.0 API driver. Allowing access through python is a little trickier than java, the first step is to create a BookStore database. Once in the BookStore directory, run the rdm-tfs command to start the server. Find the GettingStarted/examples path of the RDM install directory and then once installed itâ€™s good to go.
