The database product Information Management System (IMS) (https://www.imsweb.com/) is an open-source database. It has a heretical data model type and uses trees to organize data. The host model for this system is cloud based. Java can access this database by using the JDBC driver interface. Using the Driver interface the user need to load the IMS universal RDBC. Similarly to Java, python can use the IMS universal RDBC. The user will need to import “jaydebeapi” on the platform they are using python on. From there the user can open the IMS Open Database Manager.
