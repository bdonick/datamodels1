The database product mondoDB (https://www.mongodb.com/) is an open-source database. It has a non-relational database which is similar to a network database. The hosting model for mondoDB can be cloud based if using MongoDB Atlas. Additionally there is a mondoDB community server which acts as a client/server hosting model. In order for Java to access the database product the user will need to create a mondoDB client by initializing the mondoDB class. This can be done by using the getDatabase() method along with a JDBC driver. Access mondoDB through python is quite easy compared to java, first you download PyMongo which has all the packages for mondoDB interaction. Then you connect python to atlas to create a mondoDB database.
