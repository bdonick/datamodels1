The database product LucidChart (https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) is an open source database. It uses an ER model or Entity-Relationship model is a collection of entities and where relationships between these entities are shown. The host
model for LucidChart is embedded. The ER model is made of three major components. These are entity set, relationship set, and attributes. An ER model differs from a relational model because it deals with the relationships between the entities while the relational model deals with tuples and similariry attributes. For Java to access LucidChart the user will need to import api.LucidApi and then create a new service builder which emcompasses the LucidApi.class. For Python it has to be more specifc about the need. There are a lot of API for each specifc need so the user would use the specifc API on their Python platform in order to use LucidChart.
