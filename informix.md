The database product Informix (https://www.ibm.com/products/informix) is a commercial database. It has a relational data model type, both traditional and object. The hosting model for Informix is a client/server model. Additionally the IBM Informix can be an embedded host model. It also has the capability to be hosted on the cloud. In order for Java to access Informix the user will need to download the Informix JDBC driver. Then to connect to the database server use a DataSource object. In order for Python to access Informix you need to use DSN that will be used as a connection string. The Python Database API Specification v2.0 API  is needed to work with Informix. From my understanding Java is much easier to use when working with Informix.
